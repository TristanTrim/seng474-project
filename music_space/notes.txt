Diagram Notes

	song is a vector
	corresponds to its songID
	want to link Millon Song Suber with User taste by songID
		inner join(MSS, songID)

vec2song(song_vector):
	
	return the song id given a song_vec
	
song2vec(songID):
	return the song vec given the SONGID
	
nearest_neighbour(song_vec)

	return the nearest neighbour of the song vector provided
		when we look at the nearest neighbour of a song vector
		we want to minimize the number of nearest neighbours
		
	Idea: use sklearn.neighbors
	sklearn.neighbors.KDTREE


cost_song_per(song vector)
