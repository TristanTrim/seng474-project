# seng474-project

This is a machine learning project for the class Seng474. We intend to experiment with reinforcement learning on the problem of predicting songs a user will like based only on their reaction to the already recommended songs.

### Todo

- [~] Get the data
- [~] Write the env
- [ ] Train the robot
- [ ] Interpretability?

### Setup

To ready the codebase run:

```
python3 setup.py
```

Then to run the thing use:

```
python3 main.py
```

Please note this is in development and will likely break.
