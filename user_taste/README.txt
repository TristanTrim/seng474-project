- the ENTP dataset (train_triplets.txt) was too large to include in the repository (~3 GB), either download it at (http://millionsongdataset.com/sites/default/files/challenge/train_triplets.txt.zip) or use the included shell script (get_entp.sh) 

- ensure uid.txt and train_triplets.txt exist in 'data' directory; uid.txt must be generated with entp_reader.py as it was also too large to include in the repository

- sid.txt is also generated by entp_reader.py for intended use in music space implementation. All song id's with recorded user scores in ENTP are in sid.txt
